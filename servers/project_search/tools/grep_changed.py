    """Search for a pattern only in files modified by git.

    Combines git_changed_files with grep_code — searches only the current diff,
    not the entire project. Returns immediately if there are no changed files.
    Requires PROJECT_SEARCH_ROOT to be inside a git repository.

    Args:
        query: Regex pattern (or plain text) to search for.
        scope: Which changes to search in: "unstaged" (default), "staged", "all", or a commit SHA.
        extensions: Optional list of file extensions to restrict the search, e.g. ["php", "ts"].

    Returns:
        matches: list of matches with file path, line number, and a short snippet.
        token_savings: estimated tokens saved vs. Claude reading the changed files directly.
